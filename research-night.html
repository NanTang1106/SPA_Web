            <h2>Prof. Choe Youngjun</h2>
            <h3>University of Washington, Department of Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering; Disaster Data
                Science Lab</h3>
            <p>Professor Choe provided inspiration and advice for students hoping to do research. He
                began with introducing the Disaster Data Science Lab (DDSL), where undergraduate and
                graduate students are developing machine learning algorithms for annotating disaster relief
                routes on satellite images. The project is focusing on the Houston metropolitan area in the
                aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. Finding access routes through satellite imagery played a crucial
                role in allowing first responder to rescue people who were trapped, and the DDSL team hopes
                this new project will significantly aid future disaster relief efforts.</p>
            <p>Professor Choe also provided key points of advice for students wanting to pursue
                research:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Prioritize coursework and supplement with research experience</li>
                <li>Strive to start early, with the understanding that many of the skills will be learned during
                    the process</li>
                <li>Be conscious about what you wish to get out of the experience and have a long term
                    mindset when approaching your research. Think about possible publications.</li>
                <li>Find research opportunities through the Undergraduate Research Program Database, or
                    directly email researchers with your resume, unofficial transcript, and a few sentences
                    describing why you are interested.</li>

            <h2>Dr. McQueen James </h2>
            <h3>University of Washington, Department of Statistics, 2017</h3>
            <p>Dr. James McQueen shared his experiences in both academia and industry. While at
                UW, his research revolved around manifold learning, a technique for reducing the
                dimensionality of data to reveal underlying structures. His work culminated in a package called
                Megaman: Manifold Learning for MIllions of Points. You can check out this fusion of math,
                statistics, and programming on Github.</p>
            <p>James currently works at Amazon and oversees the experimental platform, where
                experiments for all proposed website changes at Amazon are monitored. This experimental
                process is more complicated than it seems, and some behind-the- scenes factors that must be
                considered include the long-term effects of proposed changes, ad blindness, extreme
                purchases, and different demographic marketplaces. Skills that James advises students to hone
                in on include: computer science skills (especially being able to code proficiently in at least one
                language) and being able to explain Statistics to people of all different backgrounds. For those
                hoping to go into industry, he says internships are extremely important, and he suggests
                students think about applying early on in the school, especially for larger companies.</p>

            <h2>Winnie Wang</h2>
            <h3>Senior in University of Washington, Major in Physics, Astronomy, and Philosophy</h3>
            <p>With characteristic humor and a buoyant enthusiasm, Winnie shared advice and lessons
                learned from her extensive experience in research and schoolwork. She started research as a
                sophomore and helped with the Muon g-2 collaboration with Fermilab. Winnie currently
                conducts physics and astronomy research regarding superconductors, high energy particle
                physics, and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which is being built in Chile and will
                attempt to understand fundamental questions in Astronomy.</p>
            <p>Advice she has for students hoping to get involved in research:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep in touch with professors and TA’s. Talk to your professors - you’d be surprised by
                    how much you can learn from them: how to manage time, keep things in perspective,
                    stay motivated, etc. Even if there isn’t a research opportunity for you at the moment, they
                    will know they can reach out to you should the opportunity arise.</li>
                <li>Do well in mathematical courses because they provide essential background knowledge.</li>
                <li>Do well in courses because you want to, not because of external pressures. It’s
                    important to learn how to stay motivated on your own.</li>
                <li>Talk to classmates and friends about research they are doing. They may be able to
                    connect you with opportunities.</li>
                <li>Learn programming and have fun with it. Some specific languages that are helpful to
                    learn are: R, Python, Java, and, if you’re really daring, C++.</li>
                <li>Find a potential topic that you’re really interested in and just go for it. Doing research is
                    part of the learning process.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Summary of Doing Undergraduate Research Projects</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Communicate frequently with your professor.</strong> Let your professor know you
                    and know that you care about doing research. Then, when the opportunity comes,
                    they will know to contact you about it.</li>
                <li><strong>Ask your friends</strong> if they are doing research. Let them recommend you or help
                    you find a position.</li>
                <li>It is important to <strong>maintain a high GPA</strong> if you are hoping to apply to grad school.
                    Though having research experience is a definite plus, you will be seen as a
                    weaker candidate if you cannot maintain a reasonable GPA, so plan your time
                    wisely.</li>
                <li><strong>Get involved with research early.</strong> You do not have to know how to do
                    everything before you apply; you will learn skills along the way. Finding research
                    opportunities during your first two years of college can be tough, but it is the
                    most effective way to get a sense of what research actually entails. That being
                    said, you should not feel pressured to start research before you are ready.
                    Focusing on courses or personal reflection during your first few years is also
                    valuable.</li>
                <li><strong>Try to focus on one area of interest</strong> and deepen your understanding of that
                    specific area when you are doing research. Unless you have really lost interest or
                    are not in a suitable research situation, it pays off to work on something long-
                    term.</li>
                <li><strong>Think about publications.</strong> If you want to add your research experience to your
                    resume or CV, having published or submitted a research paper is a super plus. So,
                    make a plan early. The publishing process usually takes about a year, at least.</li>
                <li>If you are a STEM major, <strong>learn a programming language.</strong> Most research
                    involves using code to do simulation and/or data analysis. Some popular
                    languages include: Python, R, Java, and C++.</li>
